# Cedar and Fern
### Name generated by some random hipster name generator

## What it does
Generates a file full of random integers, one integer per line

## Why?
It's strangely useful if you do programming challenges to be able to generate a large dataset easily

## Is it any good?
LOL NO. But it works for now. Barely.

## How to use
`$ python random-gen.py`
It'll output to a file called "test.txt". To change the size, modify the code. Seriously.
